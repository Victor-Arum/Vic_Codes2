Data analysis, visualisation, and modeling of a diabetes-related dataset.
I used Python to analyse and visualise the data and derive insights.
I used logistic regression to develop a model to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days or not.
While the accuracy score was high, recall was low. This will be worked on in future works to achieve perfection.
The project focused more on data analytics and visualisation and less on modelling.
